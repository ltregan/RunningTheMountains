        <h1>Choosing Trail Running Shoes</h1>
        <time>October 3rd 2015</time>

        <p><b><i>The two golden rules of choosing trail running shoes:<ul>
                <li>Shoes you take do not really matter much, your body will adjust over time</li>
                <li>You must run on your forefoot</li>
            </ul></i></b>
        </p>

        <p>Let's go a bit into each point.</p>

        <p>Here is the first good news: there is simply no bad running shoe. You can go to any shop, choose any
        brand and very probably you'll like a lot the shoes you took !

        <p>The reason is simple: the best shoe is... the one you have :-) Or, more precisely, the one you train
        with. What I mean by that is the more you use a given shoe, the more your body will adapt to it.

        <p>For instance
        if you use a shoe with little protection, after hitting rocks a few times your body will
        remember the pain and, without doubt, adjust the running style. If you
        use light shoes  with little cushioning, your body will become very good at landing softly. If you
        use instead a heavier shoe, your muscles will develop stronger in the uphills.

        <p>A corollary applies to choosing racing shoes.

        <p>We often hear people using
        heavyweight trainers, and flat running shoes for racing. I'd recommend the opposite instead: train with
        lightweight shoes so your body get stronger, and use heavier, more protective shoes so you can take more
        risks during the race. My worst running injury ever happened on a 10k, where I chose shoes with a too
        small drop (more on that later) and damaged very badly my Achilles tendon running too fast in the
        downhills.

        <p>More generally, buying a brand new pair of "magical" shoes the day before a race will probably cause
        nothing but injury because your body is just not used to it.

        <p>Beside the ability of your body to adjust, there are practical reasons why all shoes are basically good.
        Improvements come in very small increments every year, so  there
        is little chance to really mess things  up. Secondly, the barrier to entry is so high - having to stock
        thousands of retailers worldwide and in at least 10 different sizes - that you mostly see big brands in this
        business and they take care of their reputation. So no lemon out there.

        <p>Is it to say that all shoes are the same ? Not at all. Depending of your running style, the terrain and
        - most importantly - the other shoes you already have you'll find that some shoes are more critical than
        others to add to your collection.

        <p>Probably the best is to go by type of terrain, and show what features are the most critical for each.

        <h2>Forest Road</h2>

        </figure>

        <p>Everything can go on this !

        <p>You may not even have to buy trail running shoes - regular roadies will work.
        Trail running shoes are most useful when the road has a lateral angle and the foot is slipping either left or right.
        <p>As the surface is quite hard, you'll avoid shoes with deep lugs: you will feel them back into your foot.
        Further deeps lugs are made with soft rubber and it will wear out quickly (eg. 100km instead of 600km).
        <p>It is however also the perfect surface to try "fun" shoes, especially if forest roads are around your house
        and you go for a short 5 or 10k after work. The idea of "fun" shoes is different for everbody. For me,
        they are the lightest possible shoes feeling like air :-) The <a>ASICS Piranha</a> at 120g are a good example.
        <p>Something you may notice is that if you run slow you might land on your heel. As speed increases, slowly
        you switch from heel-strike to the forefoot. It is very important to land on the forefoot, as impact
        to your body is greatly reduced. While you can survive on road landing on your heels with a lot of
        cushioning, it will simply not be possible to sustain it on the steep downhills found on the trails.
        Injury will come if you land on your heel.
        <p>An important factor to consider in how you land is "the drop": the difference of height your shoe features between the
        heel and the front. It goes from 0mm to 14mm, 6-10mm beeing an average value.
        <p>What drop to choose ? It depends of each individual.
        <p>If I run  12km/h or below, a 12mm drop (eg. <a>Salomon XA Pro 3D</a>) will force me to land on the heel. Using
        a 6mm drop (eg. <a>Inov-8 TerraClaw 250</a>), I am pretty comfortable running on my forefoot even at low speed.
        <p>On the flip-side, not having enough drop will stretch out your calf muscles and Achilles tendon. I got injuries
        a few times, and I know I would not go below 4mm. Further, even great athletes like Kilian Jornet occasionally land on
        their heel as fatigue comes in: shoes with lower drop will usually have less cushioning and not save you in these cases
        (there are some exceptions though - the Hoka One One have a lot of cushioning while a 0mm drop)
        <p>Finally, make sure the shoes have a breathable upper - you need to feel almost an airflow as
        you run :-) </p>

            <li>Breathable mesh</li>
        </ol></b>
        </p>


        <h2>Single Trail</h2>
        <figure>
            <img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5715/21080077809_3cfec37a1c_k.jpg">
            <figcaption>Alt St. Johann to Chäserrugg</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>What is new there compared to a forest road ?
        <p>First, you usually find these trails farther from your home and you thus tend to go for a longer time.
        You will get a bit more tired, and make a few mistakes.

        <p>Personally, I know I tend to hit rocks and roots the more tired I am. Not a lot, maybe once every
        30min or so - but that's enough that I feel I will want to protect my toes. At the same time, you still want
        to feel the trail - I think it is part of the enjoyment
        to feel the grass, the rocks, the different surface you are running on.

        <p>A shoe like the <a>Inov-8 TerraClaw 250</a> is a pretty good compromise of protection yet allowing you
        to feel the ground.

        <p>If I go for an ultra race, I know they usually include quite a lot of long downhills. As much as I like
        to feel light, the lack of cushioning will force me to run a bit slower than the other
        competitors. I would thus go for something with more cushioning like the <a>Inov-8 Ultra 290</a>.

        <p>Compared to a forest road, you may also encounter wet grass and streams to cross. It might sound
        a good idea to use Gore-Tex shoes... but it's not ! Once they fill with water, they will stay spongy
        forever. It's much better to take shoes that leave water in-and-out easily with a very
        good drainage. Combined with Merino socks (which stay warm when wet), you won't hesitate
        to run through streams.</p>

        <h2>Fell Running</h2>

        <figure>

        </figure>

        <p>Fells are a particular type of terrain very popular in UK. Basically it is an unmarked trail on uneven grass,
        so you go cross-country :-)</p>

        <p>You need a lot of traction, and not a lot of protection: shoes are pretty light and with big lugs.</p>

        <p>This type of terrain is mostly absent in the rest of Europe. Yet, fell running shoes are
        sometimes advertised as "mountain shoes" - and truth to be told they are very playful in the
        mountains thanks to their good grip (good for descent) and light weight (good for ascents). You
        can jump from rock to rock like a goat :-)  </p>
        <p>Their Achilles heel is the durability though: the outsole is made of very soft rubber, which is well
        suited to soft terrains like grass. However on hard rocks, it will wear out very very quickly. Not
        a problem for champions who gets their shoes for free, but I found after 100km-150km the
        lugs to be pretty much flat ! </p>
        <p>In loose stone ground as you may encounter in the mountains,
            you'll probably have to slow down a bit due to the lack of protection.</p>

                <li>Almost no support, force your ankles to become strong</li>
                <li>Cons: Wears out quickly on hard surface. Not forgiving, to be kept for "short" distance
                    (depending of your resilience)</li>
            </ol></b>
        </p>

        <h2>High Mountain</h2>

        <figure>

        </figure>

        <p>High mountains are these situations where there isn't enough dust to leave a marked trail, basically
            you just go over rocks. It is typically above 2500m in the Alps, but can be 1500m in Corsica
        or 500m in Wales ;)</p>
        <p>Because of the rocks, you need plenty of protection when the foot
             slips: under, front and side. You will also likely encounter
        snow fields, and as the snow may crack under your weight you need this protection against
            the rocks underneath.</p>
        <figure>

            <figcaption>End of season snow in Corsica's GR20</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Rocks also mean you have little contact surface between the shoe and the ground. Big lugs will grab
        over the rocks, and give you more grip rather than trying to rely on a soft rubber.</p>
        <p>You will typically not need a lot of cushioning: since it's very technical, you will be quite
            slow and don't need much impact protection. Less cushioning  means a shoe low to the ground and
            more stability. It is especially important in steep descents:</p>

        </p>

        <h2>Snow</h2>
        <figure>

        <p>Many runners tend to stay away from snow in Winter. What a shame ! It is actually one of the best
        surface to run upon :-)</p>
        <p>Fresh snow provides a very good grip, and damp the rocks: any shoe will thus work fine. However you may encounter
        some icy sections too, and I have found fell running shoes to provide very good traction. It
        really makes a difference to use - let's say - the <a>Inov-8 X-Talon 212</a> vs. the <a>Inov-8 TrailRoc 255</a>.</p>

        <p>If you encounter snow in mountains, a stiffer shoe will allow you to put spikes (eg. <a>Camp Ice Master</a>) and provide good
        protection if the snow cracks and you hit the rocks underneath</p>

        <p><b>My best pick for snow run: <a>Inov-8 X-Talon 212</a></b></p>

                <li>Super light</li>
                <li>Cons: Not stiff enough for deep, crusted snow; foot will flex upward. Use <a>La Sportiva Bushido</a> instead</li>
            </ol></b>
        </p>

        <h2>What about neutral / motion-control / stability shoes ?</h2>
        <p>The world of marketing is very ironic.</p>
        <p>On road, big brands spent 30 years to explain they have highly tuned shoes based on how much
            your knee turns inward and put appropriate "control" features to accommodate:<ol>
                <li>Cushioned shoes for supinators</li>
                <li>Neutral shoes for pronators</li>
                <li>Motion-control shoes for overpronators</li>
            </ol>
            <p>As if 66% of the
            population  could not run without compensation, a great contribution to Darwin's theory.
            So they have basically 3 grades of control, multiplied by 3 "luxury" levels, and
        each brand thus ends up more or less with 3x3=9 types of shoes to put on the shelves. </p>
        <p>With trail running shoes, they had suddenly more variables to account for - including different
            levels of grip or cushioning for instance. Now the
        amount of permutations was not sustainable for them: they could not have dozen of type of shoes
            to sell ! Oh, no worries: now pronation control does not matter any more ! We'll just
        ignore what we have been telling to runners for 30 years, and just make all shoes "neutral".</p>
        <p>While I find the story funny, I will not complain too much about the outcome. I believe
        the more neutral a shoe is and the less things you have in the way the better it is to
        avoid stress on your body. It is better to learn to run properly then compensate for bad
        form. It is also what <a href="http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/early/2013/06/12/bjsports-2013-092202.abstract">
                research</a> says.
            </p>
        <p>There are still a few stabilized shoes out there - like the La Sportiva Anakonda. But overall,
        you'll be happy to know most shoes don't have a hard piece of plastic they try to stick under your foot
            and end-up causing pain to your arch after several hours.</p>

        <h2>Avoiding foot pain</h2>
        <p>For many years, I suffered from heavy foot pain after 25km+. Until one day I realized I was
        simply tightening up my laces too much ! I was tightening them up too much in the first place to avoid my foot to slip in front in the
        downhills and get black nails.</p>
        <p>The answer here was simple: take .5 size bigger to leave some room in front, and loose the laces a bit.
            So for a city size of EU44, I usually take EU45.5 in running shoes. Quite a lot bigger !</p>
        <p>Another source of pain are sharp rocks under the foot. As explained above, take shoes with
        stonger underfoot protection (either with a rockplate, or more cushioning).</p>

        <h2>Summary & Conclusion</h2>

        <p>In summary, here are the various characteristics to consider:<ol>
            <li><b>Weight:</b> the lighter the better for uphills, but the less features you'll get</li>
            <li><b>Drop:</b> the lower the easier to run on the forefoot at lower speeds, but
                the higher the risk of Achilles / calf injuries</li>
            <li><b>Stiffness:</b> the stiffer the more protection and the better for scrambling; the softer
                the more comfortable to run</li>
            <li><b>Cushioning:</b> the more cushioning the less pain over long distance, but the less stability
            in difficult terrain</li>
            <li><b>Breathability and water drainage:</b> the more the better ! Sorry Gore-Tex, you do not work
                outssde of base camp :-) </li>
            <li><b>Soft outsole:</b> the softer the rubber, the better the grip, the less durable the shoes; that told,
            most outsoles will last 600km+ and outlive other piece of the shoe anyway</li>
            <li><b>Lugs:</b> the deeper the lugs, the better for traction in loose ground and the less comfortable /
                durability on hard surface</li>
            <li><b>Rockplate:</b> provides underfoot protection, at the expense of softness;
                useful for long stretches on rocky & sharp trails - but it might not be necessary if the shoe
            has enough cushioning in the first place</li>
            <li><b>Fit:</b> narrow or wide toe box, it really depends of the shape of your foot. It must feel locked
                without having to tighten the laces too much, otherwise your foot will be compressed after
                2 hours and be painful.</l>
            <li><b>Stability:</b> not to be confused with "stability" in road shoes, which refers to pronation-control
                features; for trail shoes, it's  how stable the shoe feels in difficult terrains - usually
                the less cushioning, the less stack height and the more stable the shoe is. Avoid "banana shape"
                outsole which are very narrow at the midfoot, prefer a more rectangle shape.</l>
        </ol>
        </p>

        <p>The best running shoes will depend on your favorite terrain, and as your running style change what is best
        for you may change over time also - usually going to lighter and lower shoes.
        <p>All shoes will tend to overlap in usage. It's thus usually not about choosing
        just the "best" shoes, but think as a system what you need to cover all your basis.
        <p>I personally use 4 pairs:<ol>
            <li>Main shoes, with which I do 80% of my mileage; I like them quite light, firm and low to the
            ground</li>
            <li>A pair of more cushioned shoes, with more protection and drop either for long distance (eg. 100km) or
                when I have some small injury</lI>
            <li>Shoes for high-mountains, with a lot of protection</li>
            <li>Super light shoes to go run a small 5k for fun on a Sunday afternoon :-)</li>
    </ol></p>
