        <h1>Choosing Trail Running Shoes</h1>
        <time>September 27th 2015</time>

        <p><b><i>The two golden rules of choosing trail running shoes:<ul>
                <li>Shoes you take do not really matter much, your body will adjust over time</li>
                <li>You must run on your forefoot</li>
            </ul></i></b>
        </p>

        <p>Let's go a bit into each point.</p>

        <p>Here is the first good news: there is simply no bad running shoe. You can go to any shop, choose any
        brand and very probably you'll like a lot the shoes you took !

        <p>The reason is simple: the best shoe is... the one you have :-) Or, more precisely, the one you train
        with. What I mean by that is the more you use a given shoe, the more your body will adapt to it.

        <p>For instance
        if you use a shoe with little protection, after hitting rocks a few times your body will
        remember the pain and, without doubt, adjust the running style. If you
        use light shoes  with little cushioning, your body will become very good at landing softly. If you
        use instead a heavier shoe, your muscles will develop stronger in the uphills.

        <p>A corollary applies to choosing racing shoes.

        <p>We often hear people using
        heavyweight trainers, and flat running shoes for racing. I'd recommend the opposite instead: train with
        lightweight shoes so your body get stronger, and use heavier, more protective shoes so you can take more
        risks during the race. My worst running injury ever on a 10k, where I chose shoes with a very
        small drop (more on that later) and damaged very badly my Achilles tendon running too fast in the
        downhills.

        <p>More generally, buying a brand new pair of "magical" shoes the day before a race will probably cause
        nothing but injury because your body is just not used to it.

        <p>Beside the ability of your body to adjust, there are practical reasons why all shoes are basically good.
        Improvements come in very small increments every year, so  there
        is little chance to really mess things  up. Secondly, the barrier to entry is so high - having to stock
        thousands of retailers worldwide and in at least 10 different sizes - that you mostly see big brands and
        they take care of their reputation. So no lemon out there.

        <p>Is it to say that all shoes are the same ? Not at all. Depending of your running style, the terrain and
        - most importantly - the other shoes you already have you'll find that some shoes are more critical than
        others to add to your collection.

        <p>Probably the best is to go by type of terrain, and show what features are the most critical for each.

        <h2>Forest Road</h2>

        <p>Everything can go on this !

        <p>You may not even have to buy trail running shoes - regular roadies will work.
        Trail running shoes are most useful when the road has a lateral angle and the foot is slipping either left or right.
        <p>As the surface is quite hard, you'll avoid shoes with deep lugs: you will feel them back into your foot.
        Further deeps lugs are made with soft rubber and it will wear out quickly (eg. 100km instead of 600km).
        <p>It is however also the perfect surface to try "fun" shoes, especially if forest roads are around your house
        and you go for a short 5 or 10k after work. The idea of "fun" shoes is different for everbody. For me,
        they are the lightest possible shoes feeling like air :-) The <a>ASICS Piranha</a> at 120g are a good example.
        <p>Something you may notice is that if you run slow you might land on your heel. As speed increases, slowly
        you switch from heel-strike to the forefoot. It is very important to land on the forefoot, as impact
        to your body is greatly reduced. While you can survive on road landing on your heels with a lot of
        cushioning, it will simply not be possible to sustain it on the steep downhills found on the trails.
        Injury will come if your land on your heel.
        <p>An important factor to consider in how you land is "the drop": the difference of height your shoe features between the
        heel and the front. It goes from 0mm to 14mm, 6-10mm beeing an average value.
        <p>What drop to choose ? It depends of each individual.
        <p>If I run  12km/h or below, a 12mm drop (eg. <a>Salomon XA Pro 3D</a>) will force me to land on the heel. Using
        a 6mm drop (eg. <a>Inov-8 TerraClaw 250</a>), I am pretty comfortable at all speed.
        <p>On the flip-side, not having enough drop will stretch out your calf muscle and Achilles tendon. I got injuries
        a few times, and I know I would not go below 4mm. Even great athlete like Kilian Jornet occasionally land on
        his heel as fatigue comes in. Shoes
        with lower drop will usually have less cushioning and not save you in these cases.
        <p>Finally, make sure the shoes have a breathable upper - you need to feel almost an airflow as
        you run :-) </p>

        <h2>Single Trail</h2>

        </figure>
        <p>What is new there compared to a forest road ?
        <p>First, you usually find these trails farther from your home and you thus tend to go for a longer time.
        You will get a bit more tired, and make a few mistakes.

        <p>Personally, I know I tend to hit rocks and roots the more tired I am. Not a lot, maybe once every
        30min or so - but that's enough that I feel I will want to protect my toes. At the same time, you still want
        to feel the trail - I think it is part of the enjoyment
        to feel the grass, the rocks, the different surface you are running on. A shoe which is  soft enough
        can almost be rolled on itself !

        <p>A shoe like the <a>Inov-8 TerraClaw 250</a> is a pretty good compromise of protection yet allowing you
        to feel the ground.

        <p>If I go for an ultra race, I know they usually include quite a lot of long downhills. As much as I like
        to feel light, the lack of cushioning will force me to run a bit slower than the other
        competitors. I would thus go for something with more cushioning like the <a>Inov-8 Ultra 290</a>.

        <p>Compared to a forest road, you may also encounter wet grass and streams to cross. It might sound
        a good idea to use Gore-Tex shoes... but it's not ! Once they fill with water, it will stay spongy
        forever. It's much better to take shoes that leave water in and out easily with a very
        good drainage. Combined with Merino socks (which stay warm when wet), you won't hesitate
        to run into streams.</p>

        <h2>Fell Running</h2>

        <figure>

        <p>Fells are a particular type of terrain very popular in UK. Basically it is an unmarked trail on uneven grass,
        so you go cross-country :-)</p>

        <p>You need a lot of traction, and not a lot of protection: shoes are pretty light and with big lugs.</p>

        <p>This type of terrain is mostly absent in the rest of Europe. Yet, fell running shoes are
        sometimes advertised as "mountain shoes" - and truth to be told they are very playful in the
        mountains thanks to their good grip (good for descent) and light weight (good for ascents). You
        can jump from rock to rock like a goat :-) </p>
        <p>Their Achilles heel is the durability though: the outsole is made of very soft rubber, which is well
        suited to soft terrains like grass. However on hard rocks, it will wear out very very quickly. Not
        a problem for champions who gets their shoes for free, but I found after 100km-150km the
        lugs to be pretty much flat ! </p>

                <li>Almost no support, force your ankles to become strong</li>
                <li>Cons: Wears out quickly on hard surface. Not forgiving, to be kept for "short" distance
                    (depending of your resilience)</li>

        <h2>High Mountains</h2>

        <figure>

        </figure>

        <p>High mountains are these situations where there isn't enough dust to leave a marked trail, basically
            you just go over rocks. It is typically above 2500m in the Alps, but can be 1500m in Corsica
        or 500m in Wales ;)</p>
        <p>Because of the rocks, you need plenty of protection to protect you when the foot
             slips: under, front and side. You will also likely encounter
        snow fields, and as the snow may crack under your weight you need this protection against
            the rocks underneath.</p>
        <figure>

            <figcaption>End of season snow in Corsica's GR20</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Rocks also mean you have little contact surface between the shoe and the ground. Big lugs will grab
        over the rocks, and give you more grip rather than trying to rely on a soft rubber.</p>
        <p>You will typically not need a lot of cushioning: since it's very technical, you will be quite
            slow and don't need much impact protection. Less cushioning  means a shoe low to the ground and
            more stability. It is especially important in steep descents:</p>

        <h2>Snow</h2>
        <figure>

        </figure>
        <p>Many runners tend to stay away from snow in Winter. What a shame ! It is actually one of the best
        surface to run upon :-)</p>
        <p>Fresh snow provides a very good grip, and damp the rocks: any shoe will thus work fine. However you may encounter
        some icy sections too, and I have found fell running shoes to provide very good traction. It
        really makes a difference to use - let's say - the <a>Inov-8 X-Talon 212</a> vs. the <a>Inov-8 TrailRoc 255</a></p>

        <p>If you encounter snow in mountains, a stiffer shoe will allow you to put spikes and provide good
        protection if the snow cracks and you hit the rocks underneath</p>

                <li>Very good grip on snow and ice</li>

                <li>Super light</li>
                <li>Cons: Not stiff enough for deep, crusted snow; foot will flex upward. Use <a>La Sportiva Bushido</a> instead</li>
            </ol></b>
        </p>

        <h2>Summary & Conclusion</h2>

        <p>In summary, here are the various characteristics to consider:<ol>
            <li>weight: the lighter the better for uphills, but the less features you'll get</li>
            <li>drop: the lower the easier to run on the forefoot, but the higher the risk of Achilles / calf injuries</li>
            <li>stiffness: the stiffer the more underfoot protection and the better for scrambling, but the
            less commfortable to run</li>
            <li>cushioning: the more cushionning the less pain over long distance, but the less stability
            in  difficult terrain</li>
            <li>breathability and water drainage: the more the better !</li>
            <li>grip: the more grip, the less durability of your shoe</li>

        </ol>
