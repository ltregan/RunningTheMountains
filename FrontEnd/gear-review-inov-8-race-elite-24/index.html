    <content>
        <p>In a couple of weeks, I plan to run the GR20 - the mythical crossing of Corsica along the water separation line. It runs for
            180km and 17000m ascent. The typical hiking schedule is 15 days, and trail runners do it in  5 days.
            While it is not a huge distance by today's standards, what is a bit unique is that the official hiking season is June to September
            and I aim to do it end of April - thus requiring light mountaineering equipment.
        <p>There comes the Inov Race Elite 24L running pack, as it will allow me to carry a bit more equipment than the 12L
            I usually use for ultras.
        <p>Here is what I need to fit into it:<ol>
        <li>standard ultra (eg. UTMB) equipment, with base / warm / waterpoof layers etc.
        <li>an ice axe; I chose the <a href="http://www.camp-usa.com/products/ice-axes/corsa-nanotech/">Camp Corsa Nanotech</a>
        <li>strong 3-section poles with snow gaskets
        <li>running-shoes compatible crampons; <a href="http://www.camp.it/en/template01.aspx?codicemenu=1328">Camp Ice Master</a>
        <li>a puffy; went with the <a href="http://arcteryx.com/product.aspx?language=EN&gender=mens&model=Cerium-LT-Hoody">Arc'teryx Cerium LT Hoody</a>
        <li>some volume for "normal food", I need a bit more space for chips and bread as I have absolutly no intention to feed on gels and energy bars
            and skip the delicious corse "charcuterie" :-)
    </ol>


        <h3>What do you get exactly ?</h3>
        <p>You have two versions on the market of the Inov-8 24l running pack: 2011 and 2015. They have the same name,
            and - at time of writting - a google search will actually point you to the wrong version of the bag on inov-8 website:<ul>
        <li>First result in google search: <a href="http://www.inov-8.com/new/global/Product-View-RaceElite-24-SS13.html?L=26">Race Elite 24l <b>2011</b></a></li>
        <li>Latest version: <a href="http://www.ratrace.com/3707792/products/inov-8-race-elite-24---ss15---black---includes-1-x-500ml-bottle.aspx">Race Elite 24l <b>2015</b></a></li>
    </ul>
        <p>So what you want is the 2015 version, altough the 2011 is still a very good bag and can be had at a good price these days.
        <p>Depending of where you buy the bag, it might be labelled as coming with a 500ml <b>bottle</b>. If you want an extra one (which I strongly recommend for the type
            of expedition that you will use the bag for), the accessory is called a <b>soft flask</b>. So make sure not to be confused.
        <p>Please note that you might see some pictures on the web where the flasks come with drinking tubes. I did not get
            them either in the stock one, nor the extra I bought. They would come with the new Race Ultra vest, but not the Race Elite
            (altough both vests share the same front design).
        <p>So, I hope I helped clear some confusions about the versions of the bag and its accesories !
        <p>The feature list described in the official documentation is as follow:<ul>
        <li>Large weather resistant zipped pocket to rear
        <li>‘ON-THE-FLY’ bungee compression
        <li>One 500ml Softflask
        <li>Two large zipped mesh pockets to front; double as bottle holders
        <li>Two large mesh pockets to front top
        <li>Two smaller stretch mesh pockets to front top
        <li>Whistle
        <li>Two compression straps each side and two front straps
    </ul>
        <p>A few things are worth noting:<ul>
        <li>The zipped pocket to rear has two zip closers, you can thus decide to close the bag at the top
            or the bottom
        <li>the bag is bladder-compatible: there is a velcro hook at the top, and an opening in the rear
            for the tube
        <li>there is a small zip pocket inside the bag for essentials (eg. pocket money)
        <li> the front straps are mounted on elastic bands, thus allowing you to breath such as a good running
            vest should
        <li> the build is slightly water-resistant, it is not a dry bag but will resist better to most
            alternatives which are mesh-based (probably a 500cm ripstop)
        <li>the bottom pockets have elastic bands inside to hold the bottles
        <li>the small top-left pocket has an elastic band to attach the keys
        <li>two attachment top and bottom (on the left side) for a ice axe or 2-section poles.
    </ul>
        <p>Since these features are not well documented and it was a happy surprise for me when I received the bag,
            I thought I should mention them :-)
        <p>Also interesting is this educationnal video shared by Matt Brown - Product Manager at Inov-8:<p>
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GMgwaIMFQAA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </ul>


        <h3>Attaching an ice axe</h3>

        <p> It's really a great feature of the bag to be ice-axe compatible !
        <p>My ice axe is probably the shortest out there (50cm), but still I was able to hook it up and bottom:
        <p><img src="axe-up.jpg" width="50%"><img src="axe-down.jpg" width="50%">
        <p>There's no problem that any ice axe you have will fit there.

        <h3>Attaching poles</h3>
        <p>2-section poles can be put in the ice axe attachements, and 3-section poles inside the bungee cord:
        <p><img src="poledefault.jpg">
        <p>That works great if you run with a buddy, she can help you attach the poles in your back without having to remove
            the bag.
        <p>If you want to be independant and be able to store the poles without removing to the bag, I don't know any
            rucksack flexible enough to accomodate all types of poles.
            However, it is usually pretty easy to mod them. Here is the little setup I did for this bag:<ol>
        <li>Top - make a straight loop with an elastic cord:<p>
            <img src="polesup.jpg">
            <p>As it is the one supporting the weight, it has to be quite strong.
                <li>Bottom - use a cord lock that will be adjusted once at the beginning of the run, its length will depend on
                    how much load you have in the bag:<p>
                <img src="polesdown.jpg">
    </ol>

        <h3>Filling-in the pockets</h3>
        Both sides are symetrical, with the following arrangement:<ol>
        <li>a large, zipped pocket at the bottom
        <li>a small pocket in the middle, to store keys or as a little garbage pocket
        <li>a mid-size pocket on top, running underneath the small middle pocket
        </li>
        <p>In addition, the right middle pocket as an extra drawstring for keys. Here is how things look with gels
            and keys:
        <p><img src="gelsandkeys.jpg">
        <p>I admit I often have a tendency to loose things when running ultras. I thought at
            first I was just forgetful, until I heard the story of Antoine de Saint Exupery who - after his plane
            crashed in the Andes cordilleras - reported how under exhaustation he lost vital pieces of equipment like
            his gloves. Your brain can just not focus enough ! Having a dedicated pocket in front with a draw string is
            a great safety I think.
        <p>After the gels and keys come the phone. My Samsung Alpha is not the biggest one, and thanksfully I was
            able to store it in the upper front pocket:
        <p><img src="phone.jpg" width="50%">
        <p> I feel it is necessary to have the phone as easily accessible as possible from a safety
            standpoint, and Inov-8 Race Ultra is my only bag giving me the option to get the phone without removing
            the bag in tricky conditions (would I fall in a hole
            or have only one hand available to pick it up for instance). The iPhone 6 has a couple of mm more in width and lenght,
            but it might be able to fit as well. The pocket is very tight though, if you use the phone often
            to check maps and such you'l probably want to store it somewhere else.
        <p>Last but not least, come the drinking bottles. They can be secured with the additionnal band:
        <p><img src="pocketflask.jpg">
        <p>Beside the bottle provided with the bag, the other "slim" model - also made by HydrPack - fits well:
        <p><img src="flasks.jpg">
        <p>I actually preferred it since it left a bit more space in the pocket for other items. Since it
            reaches higher-up, drinking on the go was slightly easier (more on that topic below).


        <h3>On the run</h3>

        <p>For the test run, I picked a 55k / +2300m route in a hilly landscape - hovering around 1000m.
        <p><img text-align="enter" align="center" src="route.png">
        <p>The bag was loaded with the full light-mountainering equipement, total of 3.5kg without food and water:
        <p><img src="bagcontent.jpg" width="100%">
        <p>The inside of the bag is black, so it can make finding items a bit difficult - especially
            with the current fashion among ultra-runners (as opposed to road runners) to wear a lot of black. Wish
            the inside was white or some other clear color).


        <p>And off we go :-)
        <p> The bag is pretty narrow and fits well the middle of the back,
            thus giving a very good balance. Since the bag is long, load spreads evenly in a relatively thin layer
            and keeps things close to the body. While my load could have fit in a smaller 17L bag I have, I felt
            the 24L provided much better weight distribution.
        <p>Another advantage of keeping the load close to your body is that it is easier - provided you
            chose it one size above your usual fit - to pull a rain or
            wind jacket over the backpack: in quick changing weather conditions, you can go "poncho-style" and put the jacket on and off
            without having to remove the backpack. With the 24l fully loaded you will not be able to fully
            close the zipper, but still thanks to the slim design things will always be better than a back of smaller
            capacity often creating a "bubble" on the top of your bag.
        <p>In between the showers, I just remove the jacket and tighten it around my waist so it can dry without making the rest of the bag wet.
        <p>Along the same lines, the bungee cords on the back or the straps on the side are very useful to store wet
            items outside until they dry out. For instance,
            after a couple hours my overpants were full of snow :
        <p><img src="snowpants.jpg">
        <p>As I was going downhill, temperature raised and when came time to remove the pants I could store them securly with the bungee cord
            outside the back to let them dry.

        <p>Thanks to the vest design, absolutly no
            problem to rush down technical single trails. That was my first complain with other bags,
            including the well-regarded <a href="http://www.waa-ultra.com/en/backpack/11-waa0000057-3760199420344.html">
                WAA Ultra 20l</a>. Altough they are fine at moderate speed (eg. 6min /k) on
            gentle terrain, you are quickly faced with a dilemna: keep them loose and they wobble, or tighten  up the
            waist belt but you cannot breath anymore. No such thing with the Inov-8 Elite vest, everything
            stays very stable and comfortable at the same time.
        <p>The bag fits so well, I did not need to adjust any strap during the run - you can keep all the same
            settings for uphill or downhill for instance. The position of the front straps also is fixed, no problem
            with them slidding down on a guide as design of adjustable straps often use.

        <p>I got to appreciate a lot the duffle bag design: it makes everything easily accessible, while things do not fall
        on the floor when the zipper is fully opened. It may seem a small detail, but it might even more valuable
        than the vest design. It's really genius in my mind. The alternatives are usually the following:<ol>
            <li>top opening: if you want something at the bottom of the bag, good luck with that</li>
            <li>zipped-around: those bag usually lack some structure on the side; it means that as you fully open the zipper, things
            will fall-off unless the bag is on a perfectly flat surface.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If the floor is really muddy or you are doing some scrambling, you can remove one shoulder strap, rotate the bag on the side and open it while
        standing up.</p>

        <p>Now comes something people might be concerned about: without a belt, you cannot spread the load - everything is on the shoulders.
            I had a doubt too, given also that the straps are not as wide as other models designed for a much smaller capacity.
            See the comparaison with the Salomon S-Lab 12; inner lines are drawn from the Inov-8, the outer ones
            from the Salomon:
        <p text-align="center"> <img src="shouldertraps.jpg" width = "50%" margin="auto">
        <p>You can see they are about half the size, and given the extra load you would use for a larger bag
            it means about 3-4 times more pressure
            (load per surface area). While it is possible the bag could be a little more comfortable with wider straps,
            after carrying 5kg during 9 hours
            I felt absolutly no soreness on the neck or the shoulders. Given it was a winter and I had 3 layers,
            it is possible the clothing helped a little in that regard though. I would have to make the test again
            in summer conditions and a single tee-shirt.
        <p>The bottles fit good close to the body, under the ribs - even full, they move very little compared to higher
            options (eg. chest level). Unfortunatly, it means that drinking on the go while keeping the flask
            in the pocket is not very comfortable. To make it worse, if you pull the bottle out it is realy important
            to secure it again with the elastic band - I know it since I lost a bottle on my few first run :-)
        <p>A few options would be on the table to improve the hydratation:
        <ol>
            <li> Reuse the Inov-8 soft flasks with tube, as provided with <a href="http://www.inov-8.com/New/Global/Product-View-Packs-Race-Ultra-10.asp">Inov-8 Race Ultra</a>
                range; unfortunalty, it does not seem possible to buy them independantly (however I have been told it
                might be possible next year)<p>
            <li> Take 3rd party flasks with tube, such as
                <a href="http://www.ultramarathonrunningstore.com/UltrAspire-COLLAPSIBLE-BOTTLE-Soft-Flask-with-Tube-p/ua028.htm">Ultraspire</a> or
                <a href="http://www.raidlight.com/en/bottles-and-bladders/4239-soft-flask-press-to-drink.html">Raidlight</a><p>
            <li>If you keep the stock bottles, unbunckle the chest straps before you drink, it helps move the bottles up a little
            </li>
            <p>Refilling the flasks at the springs found along the way was easy, much easier than a back bladder - and
                they help balance the weight in front. For these two reasons, I would absolutly not go back to
                go back to bladders anymore - and I don't think any pro any any for racing nowadays.
            <p>Ease of nutrition on the go really depends on what you like to feed on. The bag has smaller front pockets on top,
                as pictures above they can
                hold pretty nicely a couple of gels or energy bars.
            <p>However I like to keep this kind of food for really
                the end of the day, when absorbing food can become difficult. I try to use
                "normal food" as much as possible the rest of the time - for instance nuts & dry fruits or dried meat & cheese:
            <p><img src="food.jpg">
            <p> I would usually put it in a dump mesh pocket on the side but, at the opposite of the Race Ultra, the
                Race Elite do not have these. Inov-8 has an accessory
                <a href="http://www.inov-8.com/New/Global/Product-View-Packs-Mesh-Pocket.asp">front mesh pocket</a> on catalog,
                but it is not compatible with the Elite. It would be really great to have some accessory mesh side pocket,
                the presence of adjustable side traps could open the door to such option. I can see them
                very useful to store food as described above, but also quick changing equipement such as a camera,
                arm warmers, hat, gloves or map. Beside accessibility, it would help also to transfer some of the weight onto the waist.
            <p> To store food you might be tempted to free-up one of the large, bottom pockets by keeping only one bottle in front and
                store the second in the back - then switch them when empty. Unfortunatly these Hydrapack bottles are definitively
                not made to withstand any pressure and will leak quickly if stored in a packed bag. Even if kept in the front-pocket,
                they still leak a little (with  variability from instance to instance, even if they are from the same model).
            <p>With all that said, if you are happy with gels and bars - then you would have no issue with nutrition
                on this bag. Personally, I often use 3/4 climbing pants for my running and they have the advantage to
                have large pockets into which I can store food. Plus, when you come to cross a village you look less silly
                than with these super-tight running pants ;)


            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>A very comfortable bag, even if you don't need the full 24L you will appreciate it for content
                    of 15L and more
                <li>the duffle bag design is the best choice I have ever seen: bag can be wide-opened, while limiting risk of things
                falling even in the most tricky conditions
                <li>A quite unique item, with very little competition given its capacity and weight; ice-axe
                    compatible is a big plus
                <li>A reasonnable price given the well-thought design and quality of craftmanship
                <li>Sturdy design, made for real adventures; it is in-between your typical mesh-based running
                    bag and lightweight ski touring items
            </ol>
            <p>A couple of things to be aware off:<ol>
            <li>Not side dump pockets, so think it that may affect your setup or not (especially for mid-size items
                that you want readily accessible on the go).
            <li>In my mind, the hydration system could be improved a little
                by either providing drinking tubes or (better) allow the flasks to sit higher up.
            </li>
