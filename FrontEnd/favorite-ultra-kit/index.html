                <h1>My favorite Ultra Kit</h1>
                <time>July 16th 2015</time>
                <p>After lots of sweat and tears, here is my favorite ultra kit:
                <ul class="spaced">
                <li><b>Waterproof Jacket or Smock (with taped seams and a hood):</b> <a>Marmot Super Mica</a> (260g) - good membrane, good ventilation (underarm
                    zippers, plus front pockets can also serve as openings); the well-kept secret here is to take rainjackets one size bigger so it can go over the backpack
                    and be used like a poncho - it provides more
                    breathability and, as you  can put it on or remove while keeping the backpack, it is easier to accomodate intermittent rain showers. Second
                    well-kept secret: I don't think there is really breathable rain jacket you can run with, so unless it is really pouring just rely
                    on the warmth of your body to keep you dry</li>
                <li><b>Waterproof Trousers (with taped seams):</b> <a>Inov-8 Racepant 150</a> (160g) - comfortable after longs hours, packs small
                    and large zip openings at the bottom for easy slide-in without removing the shoes; it is true it is a "just in case" item,
                    so it may worth to get the newest and more minimalist <a>Inov-8 Ultra Racepant</a> (100g)</li>
                <li><b>Survival bag (not a blanket):</b> <a>Lifesystems Light & Dry Survival Bag</a> (200g) - there are few different versions but for a few more bucks
                    this one will give you a reusable item </li>
                <li><b>Compass:</b> <a>Silva Compass Expedition 4</a> (44g) - 40K romer to fit the handed maps's scale, smoother ring than Suunto's version, pretty light - good for map work;
                    also taking the thumb compass <a>Suunto Arrow 6</a> (20g), more convenient to hold than a base plate and good enough as long as the route has enough
                    features - plus its "fast" needle stays stable as you run, it is a huge huge convenience</li>
                <li><b>Headtorch with spare batteries:</b> the days are really long on this 3rd week of June, so I hope I just need a safety item and will carry the
                    <a>Petzl Tikka</a> (45g) light with 2 packs of ion-lithium batteries (last 20% longer and 20% lighter - 40g for 6 pieces); however in case long hours of run
                    in the dark are required, I take also the <a>Petzl NAO</a> that I hacked so it can use standard 18650 (4 spares)</li>
                <li><b>Whistle:</b> integrated in the running bag</li>
                <li><b>Spare warm top:</b> one <a>Inov-8 Race Elite 185 Thermomid</a> (225g) if its  cold, or <a>Icebreaker Relay ZIP</a> (170g) if above 15C; the ZIP is the
                    must-have here, and not too tight so you can roll-up sleeves and dump heat
                <li><b>Hat:</b> <a>Salomon XA Cap</a> (it has a soft brim, good for packing) and <a>Buff</a> (50g) </li>
                <li><b>Gloves:</b> <a>North Face Etip</a> (50g), and short MTB mitaines that will be very useful to go fast on the most technical sessions
                    and protect against rocks
                <li><b>Water bottles:</b> 2x <a>Salomon 500ml Soft Flask</a> in front - easy to replenish in streams and - as opposed to bladders - you know
                    how much water you have left; but will also carry an extra bladder to be put in the backpack for long legs without water</li>
                <li><b>Fell or mountain running shoes:</b> <a>Inov-8 Ultra 290</a> - middle-of-the-range shoes not too heavy yet good foot protection; a bit rigid sole, but
                    what I might need on rocky ground; lots of room for the toes, they have the perfect fit for me</li>
                <li><b>Back-up shoes:</b> <a>Inov-8 TrailRoc 255</a> - shoes I always train with, lighter and softer than the 290</li>
                <li><b>Hill Bag:</b> <a>Salomon S-Lab Advanced Skin 12 Set</a>, most comfortable bag I have ever used</li>
                <li><b>Mobile Phone:</b> <a>Samsung Alpha</a> (110g), its big advantage is that it is quite small and battery is easily replaceable</li>
                <li><b>Altimeter & GPS:</b> <a>Garmin Fenix 3</a> (70g), what I really love is the ability to customize it so a screen can be dedicated to what you really need
                    for navigation - distance, elevation and current GPS location; depending of the ease of acquisition of the GPS signal, it gets from
                    12h to 20h  battery life - enough for a full day on the hills; the phone charged with Harvey Superwalker 1:25K maps will help to relocate
                    every once in a while</li>
                <li><b>Poles:</b> <a>Black Diamond Ultra Distance</a> (260g) - super light and easy to fold; most people don't like to run with poles,
                    and it is true that creates a bit more bulk, however it helps a lot and makes running a more complete sport by exercising arms and shoulders</li>
            </ul>
                That puts my "base" hill bag at 1800g. To which 500g food, 1.5kg water, 300g camera, 260g poles must be added.
