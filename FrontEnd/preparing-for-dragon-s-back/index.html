                <time>June 10th 2015</time>
                <p>

                    <img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/418/19104795219_ab9653f6b1_c.jpg">

                </p>

                <p>We are now a few days away from  <a href="http://www.dragonsbackrace.com">Dragon's Back</a>, a mythical race touted as one of the top 10 thoughest on feet.
                It is basically one marathon and climbing Europe's tallest mountain from  sea
                level. Every day. For 5 days. And add a half-marathon every other day on top.
                <p>After 9 months of hard training, and 4 years after having started ultras, finally comes the quiet period. A bit of rest. The calm before the storm.
                <p>Why do this race, and invest so much time in training, away from friends, family and leisury time ? It is hard to tell.
                <p>What is sure,  is that it does not make any logical sense. But human beeings are explorers, in only 50,000 years - after our first steps
                out of Africa - we colonized the entire world. We always want to know what's "behind". What's behind the next mountain. What's behind the next
                sea. What's behing the next forest.
                <p>We can't stay still. Like birds migrate, we need to explore the world. It's an instinct.
                <p>An instinct and an addiction. Social medias, movies, our modern culture makes us addicted to exploits. Nobody can be normal anymore, we need
                to do expectionnal things to prove ourselves we exist. To justify our existence.
                <p>I'll describe a bit below what I did to prepare. I cannot tell if what I did is right or wrong, the outcome of next week will tell. But
                I know I did my best and will not have any regret.

                <p>You can jump to the following sections:<ul>
                    <li><a href="#gear">Gear</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#training">Training</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#food">Food</a></li>
                </ul></p>


                <h2 id="gear">Having the right gear</h2>
                <p>That is the thing that  probably makes a lot of people nervuous about and loose sleep over, but
                    there isn't any really good reason for that -  as many <a href="http://team.inov-8.com/adam-perry-78peaks-record-attempt-final-word/"">
                    20 years-old records</a> made with 20-years old gear still hold. But it's true
                    it's nice to  get things out of the way.</p>
                    <p>Going through the kit inventory is a pretty interesting exercise, it gives an idea of why more than a race it is really an adventure.

                <h3>Mandatory 'Hill' kit</h3>
                <p>That's basically what you need to carry on your back all day to be safe.
                <ul class="spaced">
                <li><b>Waterproof Jacket or Smock (with taped seams and a hood):</b> <a>Marmot Super Mica</a> (260g) - good membrane, good ventilation (underarm
                    zippers, plus front pockets can also serve as openings); the well-kept secret here is to take rainjackets one size bigger so it can go over the backpack
                    and be used like a poncho - it provides more
                    breathability and, as you  can put it on or remove while keeping the backpack, it is easier to accomodate intermittent rain showers. Second
                    well-kept secret: I don't think there is really breathable rain jacket you can run with, so unless it is really pouring just rely
                    on the warmth of your body to keep you dry</li>
                <li><b>Waterproof Trousers (with taped seams):</b> <a>Inov-8 Racepant 150</a> (160g) - comfortable after longs hours, packs small
                    and large zip openings at the bottom for easy slide-in without removing the shoes; it is true it is a "just in case" item,
                    so it may worth to get the newest and more minimalist <a>Inov-8 Ultra Racepant</a> (100g)</li>
                <li><b>Survival bag (not a blanket):</b> <a>Lifesystems Light & Dry Survival Bag</a> (200g) - there are few different versions but for a few more bucks
                    this one will give you a reusable item </li>
                <li><b>Compass:</b> <a>Silva Compass Expedition 4</a> (44g) - 40K romer to fit the handed maps's scale, smoother ring than Suunto's version, pretty light - good for map work;
                    also taking the thumb compass <a>Suunto Arrow 6</a> (20g), more convenient to hold than a base plate and good enough as long as the route has enough
                    features - plus its "fast" needle stays stable as you run, it is a huge huge convenience</li>
                <li><b>Headtorch with spare batteries:</b> the days are really long on this 3rd week of June, so I hope I just need a safety item and will carry the
                    <a>Petzl Tikka</a> (45g) light with 2 packs of ion-lithium batteries (last 20% longer and 20% lighter - 40g for 6 pieces); however in case long hours of run
                    in the dark are required, I take also the <a>Petzl NAO</a> that I hacked so it can use standard 18650 (4 spares)</li>
                <li><b>Whistle:</b> integrated in the running bag</li>
                <li><b>Spare warm top:</b> one <a>Inov-8 Race Elite 185 Thermomid</a> (225g) if its  cold, or <a>Icebreaker Relay ZIP</a> (170g) if above 15C; the ZIP is the
                    must-have here, and not too tight so you can roll-up sleeves and dump heat
                <li><b>Hat:</b> <a>Salomon XA Cap</a> (it has a soft brim, good for packing) and <a>Buff</a> (50g) </li>
                <li><b>Gloves:</b> <a>North Face Etip</a> (50g), and short MTB mitaines that will be very useful to go fast on the most technical sessions
                    and protect against rocks
                <li><b>Water bottles:</b> 2x <a>Salomon 500ml Soft Flask</a> in front - easy to replenish in streams and - as opposed to bladders - you know
                    how much water you have left; but will also carry an extra bladder to be put in the backpack for long legs without water</li>
                <li><b>Fell or mountain running shoes:</b> <a>Inov-8 Ultra 290</a> - middle-of-the-range shoes not too heavy yet good foot protection; a bit rigid sole, but
                    what I might need on rocky ground; lots of room for the toes, they have the perfect fit for me</li>
                <li><b>Back-up shoes:</b> <a>Inov-8 TrailRoc 255</a> - shoes I always train with, lighter and softer than the 290</li>
                <li><b>Hill Bag:</b> <a>Salomon S-Lab Advanced Skin 12 Set</a>, most comfortable bag I have ever used</li>
            </ul>
                <h3>Recommended ‘Hill’ Kit</h3>
                <p>While officially "recommended", practically speaking I'd find it really hard to take the stages without these.
                <ul class="spaced">
                <li><b>Mobile Phone:</b> <a>Samsung Alpha</a> (110g), its big advantage is that it is quite small and battery is easily replaceable</li>
                <li><b>Altimeter & GPS:</b> <a>Garmin Fenix 3</a> (70g), what I really love is the ability to customize it so a screen can be dedicated to what you really need
                    for navigation - distance, elevation and current GPS location; depending of the ease of acquisition of the GPS signal, it gets from
                    12h to 20h  battery life - enough for a full day on the hills; the phone charged with Harvey Superwalker 1:25K maps will help to relocate
                    every once in a while</li>
                <li><b>Poles:</b> <a>Black Diamond Ultra Distance</a> (260g) - super light and easy to fold; most people don't like to run with poles,
                    and it is true that creates a bit more bulk, however it helps a lot and makes running a more complete sport by exercising arms and shoulders</li>
            </ul>
                That puts my "base" hill bag at 1800g. To which 500g food, 1.5kg water, 300g camera, 260g poles must be added.
                <h3>Mandatory 'Camp' kit</h3>
                <p>The race is semi "self-supported", camp sites are available every night and they will be nice enough to carry your things there. Do you think
                it really makes it easier ? Well, it only means with a lighter load you are enabled to run.
                <ul class="spaced">
                <li><b>Hill resupply bag:</b> <a>Ortlieb Rack Pack S</a> while advertised at 24L, it is actually 22L; its top loading will make it
                    easier to get food in & out - and the design is a bit more convenient for general traveling  outside of the race</li>
                <li><b>Warm sleeping bag:</b> <a>ZPacks -7C</a> - a bit warmer than what I need - but all I have. These bags are top grade, and cannot
                    be found for this combination of warm / weight / packability in any regular brand at any price</li>
                <li><b>Sleeping mat:</b> <a>Therm-a-Rest NeoAir XLite</a> - it is extremely packable and has an incredible insulation power from the ground
                    - it opened the door to some overnight expeditions that were not feasible before; take the large version, to have a sleep as
                    comfortable  as possible :-) You'll need good sleep</li>
                <li><b>Overnight dry bag:</b> <a>Ortlieb Rack Pack L</a> - only 49L instead of the max allowance 59L, things are pretty tight but
                    still ok; I think you gain back in convenience thanks to its top-load</li>
            </ul>
                <p>A few other <b>useful items</b>:<ul class="spaced">
                <li><b>Powerbank:</b> <a>Anker Astro E5 16000mAh</a> not in Apple-territory, but still a well-made item; there is so many unbranded Chinese junk items,
                    take something you can rely upon; the powerbank will be used primilarly to recharge the watch - at only 300mAH, the power bank
                    will allow for plenty of charges. It can be used for the phone and the <a>Petzl NAO</a> too</li>
                <li><b>Samsung Alpha extra batteries:</b> lightest (30g) and fastest option to recharge the phone
                <li><b>Camera:</b> <a>Panasonic GM5</a> mounted with <a>Panasonic 14mm f/2.5</a> - super sharp, resistant to flare (good
                    for landscape),  compact, fast to start-up (good for running action) with good high ISO for
                    these sunset pics; to make backup, will use a USB stick and <a>Transcend USB OTG Card Reader</a> </li>
                <li><b>Thermos Active 500ml</b> to have a warm drink at lunch time; hot or cold weather, I always found a warm salty broth to do wonders !</li>
                <li><b>Down jacket:</b> <a>Arc'teryx Cerium LT Hoody</a>, a very versatile item - I used it from cool evenings on the beach to
                    ski touring in a snowstorm by -16C</li>
            </ul>


                <h2 id="training">Putting in the miles</h2>
                <p>I started to run about 4 years ago.
                <p>At first a gentle 5k every Saturday morning. The graduation to an ultra-runner went pretty fast: I went directly from 5K to 55K +2000m, without
                 anything more than a 15K every 6 months in between. How I could finish, I have simply no idea - but I  remember it took me one week before
                I  could do a few steps without pain.
                <p>From there I stayed at around 100k +3000m per month for a few years, doing about one 40km +2000m run per month and gentle 20K every other week.
                One ultra per year, first Iron Trail 80km +5000m (16h) then Tuscany 100k +3000m (13h) and Mountain Man 80km +4000m (13h30).
                <p>Things really started to get serious in December last year, where gradually I increased the mileage to 300km / month. My stats on Strava
                say 1400km and +50000m since the beggining of the year.
                <p>I will be far to be one of the Dragon's  Back's participants will the most mileage in. My goal is just to finish, not race it. But
                even if the mileage is not huge, I did everything I could to really make the most of it:<ul class="spaced">
                    <li>I would always run as fast as I can, at  5min/km or faster on a 40k +600m</li>
                    <li>Always do my best to run the uphills, to the point of exhaustation</li>
                    <li>Eat as little as possible, and without breakfast whenever possible so the body learn to reach into the fat; as soon as my run starts,
                    endurance training starts while others need to wait 90min for their glycogene store to be consumed (or at least it is
                    my theory)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I did not take any coach, but maybe I should have. My initial reluctance was that I am more the type of person with coarse-grain goals
                such as "run 300k this month" instead of having a daily schedule. Now, everybody is different - and some people might need
                this structure to be able to stick to the training discipline.</p>
                <p>Without a coach, I probably skipped on many basis. I started to feel a lot of imbalance in my body, all the muscles building up for
                    front-back stability in the plane of runnning and very little for lateral movement. A handful sessions in  the last weeks of training
                    of 300 lungess - front, back, side - started to alleviate it a bit. I combined them with interval training - 10x  90s hill repeats (+30m
                    ascent each).
                    While I started to feel the benefits, I definitively should have started much earlier and consistenly.
                <p>But the sessions worked, I had sore muscles for 5 days the first time  and by my fourth one I felt absolutly nothing.
                <p>To enjoy training, you need variety. I did a bit of biking and ski touring, just enough as I felt like it. I find swimming the most
                boring thing on Earth, but I have to admit it does wonder to remove Achille tendinite.
                <h2>Learning to be an Explorer</h2>
                <p>You can run as many miles as you want in organized races, that does not make you a mountain man. You need to be comfortable in the
                wilderness.
                <p>To be a mountain man, you need to be on your own -
                    for hours and hours. Day or night. In  snow, rain, good weather - any condition. You need to be out there and face it. You need to know how
                    your body reacts when you are stressed and feel unsafe and not do stupid stuff which makes the situation worse. It's like
                    driving a car when beeing tipsy: you need to know you are drunk, and focus on the road markings, put extra distance with cars around
                    you, don't trust your judgement but look at the dashboard to make sure the speed is fine. It is a bad comparaison, but I don't know
                    what else to use.
                <p>Navigation is a very big part of Dragon's Back - with no road markings.
                <p>The theory of how to use a map and compass is simple, you can put it on a sheet of paper. But you need to spend long hours in the mountains,
                make mistakes and later study your route to understand what you did wrong.
                <p>Something you realize quickly is that the mistakes happen typically when you are tired and exhausted. Everything seem so easy when you can
                concentrate ! What is  very imporant is to be conscious of your mental state, identify when you are  prone to making mistakes and pay
                double attention in these cases. Believe it or not, but I went once 180 degrees in the wrong direction - South instead
                of North. A few years ago, a Marathon Des Sables also got lost for days after having made the same mistake.
                <p>I am sure somebody only walking the 5 stages of Dragon's Back
                would still do a honnest time, if  navigation mistakes are avoided. A good read on navigation by Charlie Sproson:
                <a href="http://iancorless.org/2014/08/19/navigation-101-a-basic-introduction/">Part 1</a>,
                <a href="http://iancorless.org/2014/10/28/navigation-101-intermediate-navigation-beyond-the-basics-by-mountain-run/">Part 2</a> and
                <a href="http://iancorless.org/tag/advanced-navigation/">Part 3</a>.
                <p>To prepare for the race, you need to do something a bit like Dragon's Back but on a smaller scale. For me it was 5 days in Corsica on my own,
                running every day and with long 7 to 12h days - most of it in snow. It is very good to test your
                equipment, learn when and how you loose time and know what to expect in terms of mental state. You need to anticipate when
                demotivation, exhaustation will come and not let it take it over.


                <h2 id="food">Learning to Eat</h2>
                <p>Life used to be simple: just take a couple of energy gels and go out. But as mileage increased, slowly my body reacted more and more badly to
                gels and I started to favor more "natural" food - like nuts and dry fruits. Add salty items, you just cannot take it anymore if
                    you are eating sweet food for 12 hours. Variety is important, you need to keep the mind looking forward to enjoy good food, which in-turn
                    avoids bonking.</p>
                <p>On Dragon's Back, one can replenish food by mid-course. I thus carried my daily calories in packs for each half-day. Each look
                as follow:<ol class="spaced">
                    <li><b>nuts and dry fruits (500 kcal)</b>: various glycemic indexes, energy is spread along the day - plus you'll try to eat
                        a few handful every 20min or so; different mix each day help avoid borness (eg. walnuts vs cashew nuts). Nuts have a lot of fat, I hope it will help to give energy
                        for the day after
                    <li><b>energy bars (200kcal)</b>: at the difference of the nuts & fruits designed to be eaten continuously in small bites, energy
                        bars are easier to shallow in large quantities: they are thus good to fill your stomach if you feel really hungry
                    <li><b>fruit compote (200kcal)</b>: secret food, if there is nothing you can swallow that will go in :-) it is good to reactivate
                        slowly your digestive system and be able, after slowing down the pace, to eat again in case you are on the verge of bonking
                    <li><b>4 x gels with caffeine (600kcal)</b>: if all other strategies have failed and you finally bonk, that's the best emergency food;
                    the goal is to avoid them
                    <li><b>long energy drink (500kcal)</b>: easiest way to give a consistent flow of carbs; add in some proteines to - supposedly -
                        reduce soreness on next day
                    <li><b>salt pills</b>: it took me a few races to realize it is the magic ingredient that can help me avoid bonking - especially in hot weather
                    <li><b>Tuc crackers (250kcal)</b>: salty food to avoid borness of sweet; I'm mostly craving for salty food after a few hours
                    <li><b>Dried meat</b>: that is the "variety food"</li>
                 </ol>
                    <p>So  that is about 500g to carry for each half day - and 5000kcal total per day. It is probably 30% too much,
                        but it gives variety to adapt  as the race goes - I can always remove a few things. On top of this, I am taking a lunch box and hope to put a bit of
                    the previous's night dinner to eat for lunch and bring more "real food" into the day.

                    <p>I am not a nutrionist at all, and I'd be very cautious to recommend this nutrition . But if somebody asks me what I take,
                    and what I found working for me after years of running, here you go.


                <h2>Wrapping-up</h2>
                <p>Training is finished, all the gear has been packed, all the batteries have been charged.
                <p>Now it's important to relax, remove any stress and go with a fresh mind. Start to wake-up at 6am everyday and get used to the early
                wake-up :-)
