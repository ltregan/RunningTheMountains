            <h2>Review: Race Elite 24 SS15</h2>
            <time>April 10th 2015</time>
            <content>
                <p>In a couple of weeks, I prepare myself to run the GR20 - the mythical crossing of Corsica along the water separation line. It runs for
                180km and 17000m ascent. The typical hiking schedule is 15 days, and trail runners do it in  5 days.
                While it is not a huge distance by today's standards, what is a bit unique is that the official hiking season is June to September
                and I aim to do it end of April - thus requiring light mountaineering equipment.
                <p>There comes the Inov Race Elite 24L running pack, as it will allow me to carry a bit more equipment than the 12L is usually use for ultras.
                Here is what I need to fit into it:<ol>
                    <li>standard ultra (eg.UTMB) equipment, with base / warm / waterpoof layers
                    <li>an ice axe; I chose the <a href="http://www.camp-usa.com/products/ice-axes/corsa-nanotech/">Camp Corsa Nanotech</a>
                    <li>strong 3-section poles with now gaskets
                    <li>crampons compatible with running shoes; <a href="http://www.camp.it/en/template01.aspx?codicemenu=1328">Camp Ice Master</a>
                    <li>a puffy, went with the <a href="http://arcteryx.com/product.aspx?language=EN&gender=mens&model=Cerium-LT-Hoody">Arc'teryx Cerium LT Hoody</a>
                    <li>volume for "normal food", I need a bit more space for chips and bread as I have absolutly no intention to feed on gels or energy bars
                and skip the delicious corse "charcuterie"
                </ol>




                <h3>What do you get exactly ?</h3>
                <p>You have two versions of Inov-8 24l running vest / backpack: 2011 and 2015. What can be confusing is that
                they have the same name,
                and - at time of writting - a google search will actually point you to the wrong version of the bag on inov-8 website:<ul>
                    <li>First result in google search: <a href="http://www.inov-8.com/new/global/Product-View-RaceElite-24-SS13.html?L=26">Race Elite 24l 2011</a></li>
                    <li>Latest version: Race Elite 24l <a href="http://www.ratrace.com/3707792/products/inov-8-race-elite-24---ss15---black---includes-1-x-500ml-bottle.aspx">2015</a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>So what you want is the 2015 version, altough the 2011 is still a very good bag and can be had at a good price.
                <p>The other confusing part is that the bag is labelled as coming with a "500ml <b>bottle</b>", but it is actually
                a <b>soft flask</b>.
                You can buy an extra one, and it will be - rightfully this one - called a soft flask and not a bottle.
                <p>Finally, you might see some pictures on the web where the flasks come with drinking tubes. I did not got
                them either in the stock one, or the extra I bought. They actually come with the new Race Ultra vest, but not the Race Elite
                 (altough they both share the same front design). Is it an issue ? Probably not, as I have been able to drink on the go
                even without the extra tube.
                <p>The feature list as described on the official documentation is as follow:<ul>
                    <li>Large weather resistant zipped pocket to rear
                    <li>‘ON-THE-FLY’ bungee compression
                    <li>One 500ml Softflask
                    <li>Two large zipped mesh pockets to front double as bottle holders
                    <li>Two large mesh pockets to front top
                    <li>Two smaller stretch mesh pockets to front top
                    <li>Whistle
                    <li>Two compression straps each side and two front straps
                </ul>
                <p>A few things are worth noting:<ul>
                    <li>The zipped pocket to rear has two zip closer, you can thus decide to close the bag at the top
                        or the bottom
                    <li>the bag is bladder-compatible: there is a velcro hook at the top, and an opening in the rear
                for the tube
                    <li>there is a small zip pocket inside the bag for keys, credit cards, etc.
                </ul>
                <p>Since these features are not well documented and it was a happy surprise for me when I received the bag,
                    I thought I should mention them :-)
            </ul>
