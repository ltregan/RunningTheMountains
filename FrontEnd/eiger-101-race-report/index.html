                </p>

                <p>Following on <a href="../preparing-for-dragon-s-back">Dragon's Back</a>, I have been sick and exhausted for 3 weeks... painfully climbing
                    the stairs of my apartment, with a pause in the middle. My knee is still painful, and only a week ago my meniscus did not resist even
                    a 10km run.

                <p>But just looking at some of the trail's photos, and suddenly a magic flow of energy seems to fill my body like air in a sleep mattress. Suddenly
                the desire to run a big challenge comes again. The world is so big, it fells such a shame sometimes to stay still and not take the time to
                explore it.

                <h2>Lodging</h2>

                <p><img src="http://farm1.staticflickr.com/450/19206604473_ab48ffa1a9_c.jpg"></p>

                <p>Grindelwald is not that big of a village, so I recommend to book as early as possible. You will always find some place, but they may be a bit
                far from the start - you'll regret after running the 100k to have more than 100m to reach you comfortable bed :-)
                <p>For booking you might use one of the on-line engines, but from there I recommend to call directly into you selected pick: I ended
                paying 44 CHF instead of the 35 CHF advertised at the front-desk. </p>
                <p>Good lesson learnt.</p>
                <p>The second reason to call directly is to make sure they can arrange for an early breakfast at about 3am, which gives you 90min of digestion
                before start.</p>
                <p>For some reason, people I was sharing the room with decided to wake up at... 1am :-( I have no idea why one would want to wake-up more than 3 hour
                before the race, but that really killed my night: basically you make a short night of about 5 hours to an even shorter one.
                 <p>So before everybody goes to sleep, let's agree on some gentlemen agreement :-). Or pay a little extra to be on your own.</p>

                <h2>Equipment</h2>

                <p><img src="http://farm1.staticflickr.com/400/19820289842_d4fe942e3d_c.jpg"></p>

                <p>Some people have so small backpacks, I have no idea how they passed the kit check. It's a bit of a shame, first because that do not put
                everybody on an equal stand - secondly because they compromise a lot their safety.

                <p>Because of a big storm, the  race got stopped and some people had to wait still for 1 to 2 hours. Drenched, exhausted by the effort and the body under
                caloried (is that a verb ?), without movement I could see some of the runners really suffering from the cold and shivering in spite of the fact we were
                just waiting at a warm restaurant. I cannot believe what it would have been in a mountain shelter or - worse - stopped in the wild
                after an injury. Some of these people did not have the recommended dry spare tee-shirt or rainproof pants. </p>
                <p>Now,  some optimizations are possible. I admit I did not carry the spare headlight for only 1h of night run in the morning: the E101
                    follows the same route than the E51, and the E51 did not require the second headlight. But I stuffed
                the second one in my resupply bag and had two of them for the second half. Forecast beeing reasonnably accurate for the first
                few hours, one could also have foregone the rainproof pants - but then at this point we are not beeing fair with the other runners. Feelings
                aside, it does not worth it to be disqualified just to save a few grams.</p>
                <p>With all that said, let's go on the list of equipment I chose:</p>
                <ul class="spaced">
                    <li><b>Backpack Bag:</b> <a>Salomon S-Lab Advanced Skin 12 Set</a>, most comfortable bag I have ever used. It can carry 1l of water in
                        2x500ml soft flasks, which is more than enough given all the refresment points.</li>
                    <li><b>Mobile Phone (switched on at all time):</b> <a>Samsung Alpha</a> (110g); set with mobile data off (but still SMS and calls working), it lasts
                    easily 24h.</li>
                    <li><b>Insulation blanket minimum size 1.40m x2m</b>: nothing much to say here, they are all the same. If I was alone on such a journey
                    and not a fully supported race, I would have taken a survival bag instead of blanket - check them out.</li>
                    <li><b>Whistle:</b> usually integrated in the backpack.</li>
                    <li><b>Elasticated emergency bandage (min. 200cm X 4cm):</b> Again, nothing much to say here - all the same.</li>
                    <li><b>An all-weather jacket suitable for bad mountain weather:</b> You have a couple of options there, depending of
                        the weather forecast.<br><br><ol class="spaced">
                            <li>If you know the conditions will be bad and will run for hours under the rain, I'd take a sturdy jacket and
                            with good ventilation. For instance the <a>Marmot Super Mica</a> (260g) - exceptional membrane (x2-x3 the norm), good ventilation (underarm
                            zippers, plus front pockets can also serve as openings); the well-kept secret here is to take rainjackets one size bigger so it can go over the backpack
                            and be used like a poncho - it provides more breathability and, as you  can put it on or remove while keeping the backpack, it is easier to accomodate intermittent rain showers. Second
                            well-kept secret: I don't think there are  breathable rain jackets you can truely run with and stay dry under, so unless it is really pouring it is often
                                better to rely on the warmth of your body to keep you dry</li>
                            <li>At the opposite, if the weather looks good and you need it just for safety purpose - I would go with a ultra-light one. They
                            are about half the weight and pack really small (which in-turn can free up a pocket and make things like food access easier).
                            However, I doubt they would resist more than a few dozen hours of actual use with a backpack. <a>Marmot Essence</a> or <a>Mammut Rainspeed</a> are
                                good examples of lightweight options. </li>
                            </ol></li>
                    <li><b>Spare warm top:</b> one <a>Inov-8 Race Elite 185 Thermomid</a> (225g) if its  cold, or <a>Icebreaker Relay ZIP</a> (170g) if above 15C; the ZIP is the
                                must-have here, and not too tight so you can roll-up sleeves and dump heat. I used the light one, but had the warmer one as spare
                            in my resupply-bag. </li>
                    <li><b>A pair of long over-pants, a pair of long running pants or running leg warmers:</b> I really recommend to go with waterproof
                    rainpants here, as they are not heavier and provide much more protection. I went with the <a>Inov-8 Racepant 150</a> (160g) -
                        comfortable after longs hours, packs small and large zip openings at the bottom for easy slide-in without removing the shoes; it is true it is a "just in case" item,
                        so it may worth to get the newest and more minimalist <a>Inov-8 Ultra Racepant</a> (100g)</li>
                    <li><b>A spare T-shirt:</b> as it was warm, my main top was a simple singlet. Having a spare with short-sleeves was good in case things
                    get a little cold.</li>
                    <li><b>A head-band or woolen cap:</b> I love the <a>Salomon S-Lab Sense Visor</a>, it retains sweat in warm weather and gives a bit
                    of warm when it is cold, and you add a visor for no extra weight.</li>
                    <li><b>Gloves:</b> <a>North Face Etip</a> (50g)
                    <li><b>A water bottle, waterbag or bidon:</b> 2x <a>Salomon 500ml Soft Flask</a> in front - easy to replenish in streams and - as opposed to bladders - you know
                        how much water you have left. Last benefit, you can give it to volunteers and they will gladly replenish them for you - while bladders are a bit
                        more tricky for people.</li>
                    <li><b>Running shoes:</b> <a>Inov-8 Ultra 290</a> - middle-of-the-range shoes not too heavy yet good foot protection,
                        lots of room for the toes - they have the perfect fit for me. I will have to try the new <a>Inov-8 Terraclaw 250</a>, hopefully
                    providing a bit more protection than the <a>Inov-8 TrailRoc 255</a> (if once every couple hours you have the misluck to hit a rock,
                    you can really feel it), while beeing lighter than the Ultras</li>
                    <li><b>Poles:</b> <a>Black Diamond Ultra Distance</a> (260g) - super light and easy to fold; some people don't like to run with poles,
                        but on the 101 and its 6800m of ascent - there wasn't really much discussion on the topic. Saw only a handful of persons
                        without poles. I tried both versions of the Black Diamond's - carbon and aluminium - and I have to admit that for only 20g
                        more I would go with the aluminium: they are more flexible and comfortable.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>So all that puts my "base" hill bag at 1600g. To which 200g food, 1kg water, 300g camera, 260g poles and 270g shoes must be added.
                <p> A special note about the <a>Garmin Fenix 3</a>: I have found it to last from 12 to 18 hours, depending of the ease of GPS reception. I have
                been extremely please by it on the Eiger trail, it could last the entire route !! That helps a lot to know the remaining ascent and be
                able to manage the effort. Of course, I did not use the UltraTrac mode which is really <a href="../fenix-3-ultratrac-review">not
                    adapted</a> to trail running.</p>


                <h2>The start</h2>
                <p>There is a pretty long single-trail during the first hour. If your goal is to finish within the first 30%, I recommend to take a start a little
                bit faster than you are used to, not to be stuck with the crowds and make sure you can  take the first climb at a good speed.
                    <p>This photo gives
                a little idea of the line:

                <h2>The food</h2>

                <p><img src="http://farm1.staticflickr.com/415/19204918714_652b9b1901_c.jpg"></p>
                <p>Kudos to the race organizers, who provided top food with Sponser. However I admit it is not for everybody, I found many options
                either too sweet or too dense for me - especially on this warm weather. The result is that I did most of the route in bonked zombie
                state, which is really a shame given the beauty of the scenary.</p>

                <p>A few personnal takeaways:<ol>
                    <li>I wanted to save weight, but I should taken some of my habitual food - such as dry fruits and nuts; you can always ditch them if you
                    happen not to need it</li>
                    <li>Wet bread in bouillon is a good way to absorb carbs if your body cannot take sweet food anymore</li>
                    <li>There are lot of cold water springs and streams; better to refill from these instead of the warm water found at the aid stations</li>
                    <li>I had never tried the "Race Ultra Pro" shake from Sponser, but it actually did wonder ! It gives fast without tasting
                    too sweet.</li>
                </ol></p>


                <h2>Dealing with injury</h2>
                <p><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3706/19833910765_54ca92e98e_c.jpg"></p>

                <p>I'd be the first one to say not to run with injuries and let things heal at their pace. However quite a few
                times I have to admit some injury that did not want to go away got much better after some good run, probably as things get warm
                again you give the chance to seized muscles and such to reach a different state.</p>

                <p>Luckily for me, it was one of these times. A small part of my meniscus got loose after an injury, and blocked my knee. I thus stopped
                    running for 3 weeks, with the small exception of a short 10km test run - which actually turned quite negative.</p>
                <p>But nonetheless, I still gave it a try to the race. Flats and uphills were good for the first 2 hours, but as soon as we started to go downhill
                the pain came and only got stronger. The first 6 hours were quite difficult, I had to walk down most of the technical sections - where
                I usually pass a lot of people. So I lost quite a lot of time.</p>
                <p>Strangely, after 6 hours the pain eased by two third and I could again run the downhill sections at a moderate speed. Probably
                the small bit of my meniscus moved a little out of the way. That allowed me to maintain a honnest speed for the remaining of the course,
                and finish in the first third.</p>
                <p>Now 36h after the finish, my knee is doing good. It does not feel I made things much worse by running over the pain. </p>



                <h2>Markings</h2>

                <p><img src="http://farm1.staticflickr.com/357/19206639733_e619fd8bdf_b.jpg" width="50%"></p>

                <p>The route is very well marked, there is really no issue to follow it. You have to be a tiny bit more careful at night, I took a
                wrong turn.</p>

                <p>I do not know how long it takes for the markings, often painted on the trail, to go away though. Out in the wild, it is not very
                pleasant for hikers to see yellow or orange arrows everywhere. If my memory is correct,  on the Mountain Man they were using
                a bit less intrusive options. But in all cases, I am certain the Eiger trail has overall a very positive impact on the mountains.</p>

                <p>Every 5km a sign indicates the remaining distance. It helps quite a lot mentally to see these little signs, and break the journey
                in smaller steps.</p>

                <p>While the advertised distance is good - 101km - the ascent is way off: it is supposed to be 6800m, but the <a>Garmin Fenix 3</a> show
                1000m  less. Checking with my experienced friend pro runner Timon from <a href="http://www.marmotatrailrunning.ch/">Marmotta Trail Running</a>, he confirmed
                the ascent is actually closer the 5800m as measured by the watch.</p>
                <p>Given the weather changed a lot from sunny to cloudy and big storms, challening for a barometric sensor, I would
                say I am quite pleased by the ccuracy of watch. The auto-calibration of elevation based on GPS data was turned off.</p>

                <h2>Storm Alert</h2>
                <p><img src="http://farm1.staticflickr.com/433/19832422281_4c2471abc8_c.jpg"></p>
                <p>As it is common in the mountains after a warm day, a big storm cracked out by the end of the day at around 9pm. For safety reason
                the race got stopped, and people were asked to wait when they reached the next aid station on their way. Kudos to the
                organizing team to manage 400 people out of night in the mountains and in those conditions ! </p>
                <p>The danger was not that much because of the rain, but the lightning. One local later told me it was the biggest one she saw in
                20 years.
                <p>Personnally I was down in the valley already. If there was a bit of fun running under the warm rain, it quickly ended during the
                waiting time of when the race got stopped. Every got cold and shivering quickly - all that spare equipment got super useful. My small
                group was lucky to be at a restaurant, so we could order warm drinks there.
                <p>Starting again after 1h wait was a bit difficult for some, as muscles got stiff and soreness started to come.
                <p>We all appreciated the slightly shorter route - 3k instead of 8k - to the finish !!! </p>


                <h2>Conclusion</h2>

                <p>Huge thanks to the team and all the volunteers ! As well as the wonderful time spent with people along the trail.</p>
