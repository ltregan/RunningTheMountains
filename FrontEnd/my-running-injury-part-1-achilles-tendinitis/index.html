                <h1>My Running Injury part #1: Achilles Tendinitis</h1>
                <time>November 12th 2015</time>

                <p><i>In this serie, I'll describe running injuries I went through. I'm not giving
                advice to anybody, but just describe what I went through.</i></p>

                <h2>What happened ?</h2>
                <p>I was on my local 10k trail race, running at a pretty good speed of 3:55 / km.
                    In the last 3km, there are a couple of short downhill sections of about 100m. The
                grade is steep enough to propel you forward, but not so steep you need to break - needless
                to say you go at full speed on it. I was wearing minimalist shoes (New Balance MT10) I had
                    trained with at moderate speed, but never really pushed it with them. </p>
                <p>During the downhill, I suddenly felt very strong pain in my Achille tendon. It was
                as if the foot was loose without much support from the tendon. I finished the last 3km
                running, without slowing down in any way.</p>
                <p>Following that, I could barely walk for a week and did not run for 3 weeks.</p>

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Even before my running days, I always had high sensitivity of my Achille tendons.
                For instance pushing on my foot while skating would make it painful for a couple
                of days.</p>
                <p>Since I started running, I had chronic pain. Waking up in the morning,
                tendons would feel pretty stiff and painful until I walk a little. Wearing 6mm
                drop shoes, I would also feel a mild pain after a run. Adding 2mm inserts (so 6+2=8mm drop)
                would greatly alleviate it.</p>
                <p>Amazingly, swimming for 40min would totally remove any of the pain for a couple of hours. I am not
                sure if that is due to the swimming, or the fact that I swam in river and the cold
                immersion was helping.</p>
                <p>I had experience with 0mm drop shoes, wearing them to work every day. I had
                also made a small dozen of 5-10k runs with them, but all at moderate speed.</p>

                <h2>Treatment and Recovery</h2>
                <p>I did not see any inflammation or bruise in my foot, I thus concluded the tendon
                was not broken and - good or bad - I did not consult a doctor.</p>
                <p>I did a few exercises to make the calf muscles stronger and stretch things out,
                    following the Stanish protocol, followed by icing after each session. It is documented
                    <a href="http://www.nantes-mpr.com/cheville/tri_exo.htm">here</a>.  </p>

                <h2>Aftermath</h2>
                <p>3 weeks after the injury, and without any running in between, I attended the
                Tuscany 100k ultra. Everything went good during the race, and could complete it
                in a good time.</p>
                <p>Strangely, running 12h at moderate speed seemed to have helped heal the injury.</p>
                <p>About 2 years later, I significantly increased my mileage from 100k/month
                to 300k/month. In the process, the chronic pain disappeared and I don't feel
                anything waking up in the morning now.</p>

                <h2>Learnings</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Speed is dangerous ! You may have the fitness, but it does not mean the rest
                    of your body will follow.</li>
                    <li>Current wisdom is to use heavy shoes for training and lightweight for racing. I
                    think doing the opposite is much safer ! I did use more cushioned and higher
                    shoes the year after at the same race, won 3min on the 45min compared to the year
                    before and had not issue whatsoever.</li>
                    <li>I should probably have addressed my chronic pain earlier</li>
                    <li>Achille tendinis is a good example where active recovery is pretty well
                    accepted in the field; Stanish's protocol rules !</li>
                    <li>Minimalist shoes are fun to run with, but use them with reason.</li>
                </ol>
