                </p>

                <p>I've been very inspired by the photos of Patitucci of the Hardergrat, they went worlwide and even made it to multiple
                magazines. </p>
                <p>The ridge - or "grat", as it is called in German - is only a couple of hours far from my home so I patiently waited for
                a window of clear weather and drove down there a the first opportunity</p>
                <p>The challenge for me was two fold. First, as a hiking: stretching 20k and with 300m cliffs on both sides,
                    it would definitively be my most technical route. Secondly, I was very interesting in seeing how my photos
                would compared compared to the very best of the pros out there and take good learnings.</p>

                <h2>The route</h2>
                <p>The route start by a nice single trail in the forest, up from Interlaken to Hardergrat Kulm.</p>
                <!-- https://www.flickr.com/photos/ltregan/20055126781/sizes/l -->
                <p><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/294/20055126781_7b63674afd_b.jpg"></p>
                <p>An hour more, and you leave the forest to reach the open land. Magnificent views from the mountains surround you.</p>

                <p>Finally you reach the ridge. You discover a few bits at first, then quickly its endless stretch that disappears in the
                morning fog.</p>

                <p>It definitively gets a bit scary to look at what is ahead, but you know the only way it to take it step by step.</p>
                <p>Sometimes, looking back is the best way to realize all the way accomplished.</p>

                <p>I got the chance to see a few mountain goats. They seem to be quite used to people, and you can approach
                them pretty close.</p>

                <h2>Lodging</h2>
                <img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/264/19428976683_25eefb4074_h.jpg"> <!--https://www.flickr.com/photos/ltregan/19428976683/sizes/h/-->
                <p>The ridge is between Brienz and Interlaken. With frequent train connections between the two ( every hour) and a short 20min
                ride, you can easily leave you car in Brienz, go to Interlaken and sleep there. The tradition seems to take the ridge
                from Interlaken to Brienz, and it makes sense as the slope is gentler (1000m instead of 1700m climb  to reach the
                    base of the ridge).</p>
                <p>I wanted to start before sunrise, it thus made little sense to take a hotel room. My plan was to arrive in Interlaken
                by the evening and sleep in the car. The trailhead  being right in the city,  parking spaces are extremely limited and many
                    do not allow you to leave the car more than a few hours. It thus proved challenging to go with my intended plan,
                I'd really recommend to book a cheap room for comfort. I would give it a try with the
                    <a href="http://www.villa.ch/">Villa Sonnenhof </a>.</p>
                <p>Interlaken itself is a nice town - tough touristy - so it's worth to spend some nice relaxing time there. Brienz
                is even nicer and quieter, and I have seen it featured as one of the nicest villages of the Alps. If you don't mind
                a start at only 6am, the first train in the morning will get you to Interlaken. However I would recommend to start
                an hour earlier from Interlaken, it allows you to get to the ridge only a little after sunrise and have nicer
                views.</p>


                <h2>Planning for Food and Water</h2>

                <p>Food is plenty, you'll have no problem to rely on the local delicacies:</p>
                <!-- https://www.flickr.com/photos/ltregan/19861915730/sizes/l -->
                <p><img  src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3750/19861915730_d0c4f8f03d_b.jpg" ></p>

                <p>As for water it is a bit more difficult, there is none on the ridge itself. For that reason,
                    it is important to start as early as possible and avoid the hot temperatures.
                <p>The last point where your can replenish is at the Harder Klum station (in the toilets), about a hour up from the start.
                If you arrive a bit later in the day, you may find the restaurant (5min from the station) open too.</p>
                <p>It took me 8h to do the ridge itself, I carried 2.5l of water and used almost everything. I am used
                 to drink in springs and streams when need arise - but in this case no water really means "no water".</p>

                <h2>The terrain</h2>
                <p>The terrain is usually very soft.</p>
                <p>The way up is in the forest, almost "sand-like" with a few roots:</p>
                <!-- https://www.flickr.com/photos/ltregan/19861721108/sizes/l -->
                <p><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/354/19861721108_31f6f8726d_b.jpg"></p>
                <p>Once on the ridge you will encounter  the same soft ground, but sometimes covered by grass or rocks: </p>
                <p><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/479/20049915325_456b4c35f5_h.jpg"></p>
                <p><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/416/19428953363_b3868e556c_b.jpg"></p>
                <p>Finally, the 8k / 17000m way down to Brienz is on a mix of diverse terrains.</p>

                <h2>Is the route really difficult ?</h2>
                <p>The route is very impressive, with big drops on both sides. Some people have died there as some
                    crossed reminds the hikers:</p>
                <p><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/418/20049936285_eeb2472133_b.jpg"></p>
                <!-- https://www.flickr.com/photos/ltregan/19861852158/sizes/l -->
                <p><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/267/19861852158_e1fbef5095_b.jpg"></p>
                <p>You should definitively not do the route if it is windy or wet. Personally I waited 36h after the last rain. As I started
                early in the morning, I still found some dew on the grass until 10:30am and had to be a bit more careful.</p>
                <p>That told, there are few positive points:<ol>
                    <li>Navigation  along the ridge is easy, even in fog you don't have much decisions to make</li>
                    <li>No scrambling, everthing can be be done without hands except for a handfull of sections</li>
                    <li>Even at its thinnest, the ridge  is at least 50cm to 100cm wide; so if you are not afraid of
                    heights, there isn't really a reason to slip.</li>
                </ol></p>
                <p>The first part from Interlaken to Schnierenhireli is definitively much easier than the remaining of the route, and
                it has quite a few exit points. Once past Schnierenhireli, things get a notch harder and furthermore does not have
                as many exit points. I would recommend to leave there if you feel close to your limits, the more tired you are
                the more likely you are to make mistakes - there is no need to push it too far.</p>

                <h2>What gear to take ?</h2>

                <p>First of all, the shoes. No much debate here. fell running shoes will work wonderfully:</p><ol>
                    <li>soft ground</li>
                    <li>need the best possible traction</li>
                    <li>stay as low to the ground as possible for stability</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The <a>Inov-8 X-Talon 212</a> are a perfect choice:<p>
                <p><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/336/19896954939_da2be013c3_b.jpg"></p>
                <p>Hiking poles would be great the first half of the route, but it is probably better to pack them after
                    Schnierenhireli. As the section is more technical, having the hands free will you give a bit more
                    assurance and maybe go faster.  The <a>Black Diamond Ultra Distance</a> are great here, as they pack small and light and
                you won't even feel them.
                <p>As mentioned earlier, water is a challenge. You definitively need a water system that tells you
                easily how much water you have left. The combination of a bag with 2x500m front flasks and a 1.5l
                back bladder ("camel back") is great. I took the <a>Salomon S-Lab Advanced Skin 12 Set</a>.
                <p>On top of this, take the <a href="../favorite-ultra-kit/">usual mountain equipment</a> based on the weather conditions.</p>
