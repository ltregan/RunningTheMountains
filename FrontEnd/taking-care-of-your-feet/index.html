                <h1>Taking Care of Your Feet</h1>
                <time>November 16th 2015</time>

                <p>As runners, one of the great benefits of our sport is that we get fit. That is all
                good, except that often our poor feet are
                often sacrificed in the process.</p>
                <p>During the Dragon's  Back race, a good 20% of abandons had to do with unproper
                care of the feet - typically blisters getting infected and forcing the competitor
                to stop. </p>
                <p>But it does not need to be that way ! Yes, you can run and have happy
                    feet too. I'll share here the tips I learnt.</p>

                <h2>Black Nails</h2>
                <p>Black nails are caused by the nails hitting the front of the shoe, typically
                during the downhill sections.</p>
                <p>Before getting black nails on long runs, you will
                    feel some pain on shorter runs.
                    Just pinch your nails one by one, and if you feel anything
                    you can easily do something about it before it gets worse:<ul>
                        <li>Cut your nails short, but not so short that the delicate matrice (skin-nail connection)
                        is touched - your nails will become shorter and shorter and not have a
                            good regeneration process. </li>
                        <li>Do not hesitate to take your shoes really large; for instance I wear 43-44 in
                        city shoes, but I take 45.5 in running shoes.</li>
                        <li>Different shoes have different toebox profiles. On the La Sportiva Bushido, my big toenail
                        is the most exposed, but the middle finger in Inov-8 Standard fit. If you feel you already
                        went a few size up, consider changing shoe type.</li>
                        <li>Too small socks can also be a problem; if too large however, they may
                        create wrinkles under the foot and create blisters.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>During the run, you will certainly feel your nails being smashed. It will not be
                too painful as your body is pretty good to kill pain, but you will feel it. Do not ignore
                    these warning signs, and make a small
                stop to adjust things. You can tighten up your laces so the foot is locked in the back
                of the shoe, and even do this proactively before long downhill sections. Socks - especially when wet - have a tendency to be pulled back; remove
                    your shoe and move it back to the front. </p>
                <h2>Blisters</h2>
                <h3>Prevention</h3>
                <p>Blisters are caused by hard surface against your skin. So you can that can include:<ol>
                    <li>the shoe itself</li>
                    <li>bits in the shoe (eg. sand)</li>
                    <li>possibly wrongly adjusted socks (eg. too big and making wringles)</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>Obviously, get rid of all these things as much as you can. A small stone might not be
                a big issue on a 20k, but can be disastrous for a day-long run.</p>
                <p>The harder the skin, the most likely also to get blisters. Prevention is thus to get rid of the hard skin with a couple of tools:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>nail file, to remove the biggest spots; make your feet as soft ass you can</li>
                    <li>some urea-based foot cream, that you can apply before sleep</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Before running, you put can creams (eg. Compeed Anti-Blister stick, or more traditional
                    beewax-based versions).</p>
                <p>After each day of running, make sure to clean you feet and dry properly so they can
                    recover as much as possible overnight. It may
                seem obvious, but on long multi-day runs you can be so tired that the only
                thing coming to mind is to go to sleep.</p>
                <p>Certain sock materials can cause easily blisters when wet. I found merino socks
                to be pretty safe for such cases, not to mention that they stay warm when wet. For
                full-day runs, drying the feet with a towel and put fresh socks is recommended.</p>
                <h3>Treatment</h3>
                <p>First thing, if you don't run the next day - you can just let it heal
                slowly. That also applies if the blister is deep enough, adding tape and other things
                could cause other problems - altough some people successfuly manager to tape their
                feet in a proactive way.</p>
                <p>If the blister surfaces and will probably open on your next run:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Crack-open the blister to remove any liquid</li>
                    <li>Warm-up a Compeed plaster between your hands, and apply it on the blister</li>
                    <li>Tape it up so the plaster stays in place</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Foot pain</h2>
                <p>When you begin to run, you just have "foot pain" - without really feeling
                    where it come from, it feels very diffuse. With experience, you will get a better
                sensitivity and can identify a few parts:<ul>
                    <li>heel: typically people using minimalist shoes and running on their heel; better
                        to  change your strategy here before suffering from micro-fractures</li>
                    <li>side:the foot will swell under long runs; it might be that the shoes are too
                    narrow, or it is laced too tightly</li>
                    <li>under: it is typical for me running for a couple of hours on "goat trails", paved with sharp rocks
                        <br><img src=""><br>
                        Upgrading the shoes to a stiffer or thicker sole (eg. Inov-8 TrailRoc 255 to Ultra 290 )
                        will make a significant difference.
                    </li>
                </ul>
